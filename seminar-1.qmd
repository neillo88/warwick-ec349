## Overview

The goal for this seminar is to:

- ensure everyone has successfully installed R and RStudio;
- review some R basics;
- review `tidyverse` packages
  - `ggplot`
  - `dplyr`
- create and publish a RMarkdown file;
- introduction to GitHub.

## Installing R and RStudio

Follow instructions outlined at <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.

More advanced users may wish to investigate [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), a new IDE for R from the creators of RStudio. 

## R basics

## 'Tidy' data with `tidyverse`

[`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a package designed for data scientists. 

## RMarkdown

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is a markup language. It includes relatively simple formatting that can incorporate more "creative" features through embedded HTML and CSS elements. 

When programming in R using a `.R`-script file, by default, text is treated as code. If you want to leave a comment, you need to comment-out the line using `#`. Markdown files flip this around: by default, any text is treated as plain text. Executable code must be placed within a code block for it to be executed. These blocks are then executed as a sequence of "chunks".

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(4,5,7,9)
```

Markdown files have a number of useful features; including, 

1. intuitive combination of code and text;
2. straight forward embedding of grpahs;
3. publication in a number of formats (including, html, pdf, docx);
4. inclusion of LaTeX.
